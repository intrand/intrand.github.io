If you're learning how to push buttons, or already do so, I hope you'll find some of my stuff informational or perhaps useful. You will find I focus on containers, specifically. I've done a lot of other things, but that's my primary interest. A Message to Learners \u00b6 You're interested in IT, huh? You want to run some fancy software and play with things, but aren't sure where to start? I highly recommend getting yourself some extra Intel or AMD machine if at all possible. An old laptop or tower would be exceptionally overpowered for learning purposes. If those aren't options, you could attempt to run a virtual machine on your laptop or desktop. As a last resort, you could use a latest-generation Raspberry Pi as a cheap way to expose yourself to managing Linux systems. Unfortunately, not all software is readily available in arm64 flavor, so this option is somewhat limiting, depending on what exactly you want to use/learn. tl;dr : You don't need a beastly rackmount server chassis with multiple CPU sockets and 512GB of ECC RAM to understand how systems work. Keep it simple. Once you have a spare machine (virtual or physical) to play around with, I highly recommend using Ubuntu or CentOS Stream as your operating system, since those are the same or similar to what most companies use. From then on, it's totally up to you! If containers are your thing, I recommend installing k3s or k3d and going ham. Projects \u00b6 You can check out my repos on github for a complete list of open source projects. I'm primarily interested in... wg-meshify : A wireguard configuration generator duplicity-backup : Automated, headless duplicity backups rsync : rsync reciever for duplicity-backup , or any SCP client ansible : ansible-playbook inside a container Non-technical \u00b6 The great outdoors is nice. I try to spend as much time out in it as possible. You'll quite often find me near lakes and trails. Other times you'll find me building or fixing things.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#intrand","text":"I push buttons to make a living.

Rules The activity works like so... Someone has a sheet of lined paper and writes a single word to start a story. That person then passes the paper to the person next to them. The recipient then writes the next word in the sentence/story. The paper is again passed to the next person and the process repeats until the story is complete. Design \u00b6 storytime was comprised of three parts: db : A Mongo database that stored all of the stories metadata related to each entry within a story. api : An API server that handled all of the requests to/from the database. discord : A discord bot which joined servers and listened for new messages in a configured channel id for that server (also configured by id). It was the gatekeeper / main interface to the API server. web : A web server that used template-driven page generation to take data from the API server and make a clean, readable web page. Users would type their message into the designated discord channel and the bot would react to tell you if the message was accepted or not. discord bot reactions = message was accepted and recorded = message was too long, contained something really nasty (html, etc), or there was some kind of error on the back-end = unknown status; check your story on the site and perhaps try again, depending on whether or not it made it in Fatal flaws \u00b6 There's one obvious flaw to making a bot, website and database to record, show and store stories, respectively: you can just do this using discord natively. All it takes is agreement from the community to follow the rules of telling a story together. storytime discord Easy to write stories Easy to read stories Persistent Avoided clutter Low maintenance Secure It was frustrating to go between a webpage to read the story, and discord to write the story. These shouldn't have been separate. See the conclusion for more thoughts on this. Conclusion \u00b6 Building a set of services around using discord wasn't the right design choice for this project. I think this would work far better as a web-only service that people could sign up for using their discord, google, github or whatever identity provider(s) they wanted.","title":"Storytime"},{"location":"Projects/storytime/#storytime","text":"storytime was an attempt at recreating an experience as a child using discord instead of a room full of kids/people.
