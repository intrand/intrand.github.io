If you're learning how to push buttons, or already do so, I hope you'll find some of my stuff informational or perhaps useful. You will find I focus on containers, specifically. I've done a lot of other things, but that's my primary interest. A Message to Learners \u00b6 You're interested in IT, huh? You want to run some fancy software and play with things, but aren't sure where to start? I highly recommend getting yourself some extra Intel or AMD machine if at all possible. An old laptop or tower would be exceptionally overpowered for learning purposes. If those aren't options, you could attempt to run a virtual machine on your laptop or desktop. As a last resort, you could use a latest-generation Raspberry Pi as a cheap way to expose yourself to managing Linux systems. Unfortunately, not all software is readily available in arm64 flavor, so this option is somewhat limiting, depending on what exactly you want to use/learn. tl;dr : You don't need a beastly rackmount server chassis with multiple CPU sockets and 512GB of ECC RAM to understand how systems work. Keep it simple. Once you have a spare machine (virtual or physical) to play around with, I highly recommend using Ubuntu or CentOS Stream as your operating system, since those are the same or similar to what most companies use. From then on, it's totally up to you! If containers are your thing, I recommend installing k3s or k3d and going ham. Projects \u00b6 You can check out my repos on github for a complete list of open source projects. I'm primarily interested in... wg-meshify : A wireguard configuration generator duplicity-backup : Automated, headless duplicity backups rsync : rsync reciever for duplicity-backup , or any SCP client ansible : ansible-playbook inside a container Non-technical \u00b6 The great outdoors is nice. I try to spend as much time out in it as possible. You'll quite often find me near lakes and trails. Other times you'll find me building or fixing things.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#intrand","text":"I push buttons to make a living.
