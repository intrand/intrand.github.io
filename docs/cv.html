<div class="date">
	April 2020 – September 2021
</div>

<ul>
	<li>Was a major player in overall architectural decisions:
	<ul>
		<li>Provided business justification for platform design changes to upper management.</li>
		<li>Evaluated several Kubernetes flavors and implemented POCs for the final two options.</li>
		<li>Played a key role in implementing agreed upon the revised platform design (ansible, internal tooling, automated deployment, polical alignment meetings, etc).</li>
		<li>A similar cycle occurred for changing/updating applications that ran within the cluster to provide much greater out-of-the-box value for customers.</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Deployed a ton of kubernetes clusters at the edge in production - over 2000 of them!</li>
	<li>Managed all kubernetes clusters on a team of just 5 people! This was accomplished with internal tooling + Flux (GitOps Toolkit by Weave Works), and a sprinkle of Ansible.</li>
	<li>Motivated my team to improve upon their skills & knowledge in various areas. Routine and ad-hoc meetings to learn new things and brush up/expand upon existing knowledge.</li>
	<li>Received many awards for going above and beyond what was required.</li>
</ul>

<div class="date">
	May 2015 – May 2019
</div>

<ul>
	<li>Deployed an additional datacenter from empty cabinets to full production workload,
	including Dell, Lenovo and HP servers, Cisco UCS blades, Cisco ACI fabric, VMware,
	Ubuntu and Windows operating systems, and Datrium and NetApp FAS storage arrays.</li>

	<li>Automated the provisioning of Kubernetes clusters using Ansible, Etcd, Kubeadm and
	Kubectl. Later, using RKE (Rancher Kubernetes Engine) to automate building new clusters.</li>

	<li>Implemented full stack monitoring using Prometheus, AlertManager, Grafana and various
	exporters, some custom made in Python, to predict failures and schedule preventative
	maintenance before problems arose.</li>

	<li>Automated cloning process of Oracle E-Business Suite production environment to nonproduction to rapidly solve production issues using Bash and Python. Days of manual labor
	turned into two hours of machine time, able to be scheduled in advance.</li>

	<li>Consulted with developers and system administrators across the company to develop and
	oversee Linux operating system standards, best practices, security, idempotent configuration
	management and more. “Pets” became “cattle” using Ansible, Active Directory, Gitlab and
	some custom APIs.</li>

	<li>Regularly worked with teams across the corporation to ensure systems and procedures met
	strict SOX compliance requirements.</li>

	<li>Re-architected proprietary monolithic applications into micro-services based on company

</div>

<ul>
	<li>Completely overhauled antiquated networks of computers, including everything from bare
		metal to applications.</li>

	<li>Achieved user growth by augmenting existing infrastructure on significantly limited
		budgets. Containerization helped keep costs down while increasing uptime.</li>

	<li>Implemented automated on-site backup, off-site backup and disaster recovery procedures
		for relatively little capital, which resulted in much safer business operation.</li>

	<li>Held regular user training sessions.</li>
</ul>




<!-- Projects -->
<h1>Independent Projects</h1>
<ul>
	<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Storytime</span> (2019-2020): A service that allows a discord community to write a story
		collaboratively. There are hundreds of users to date.<br/><br/>
		Storytime is written entirely in Python, containerized and deployed using Docker and Kubernetes,
		alongside its MongoDB database.</li>

	<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">InitVm</span> (2018-2020): Automated VMWare deployments using a simple website interface.<br/><br/>
		Behind the scenes it runs multiple Python programs, each in their own Docker container, to take in
		secrets (credentials, tokens, etc), connect to various resources (IPAM, storage, etc) and finally run
		Ansible playbooks to build your VM the way you want it. RabbitMQ handles the brokering of jobs
		to workers as requests come in from the Python Flask API.</li>

	<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Idle</span> (2016-2020): A simple game that rewards you for simply being logged into the service, via
		website or discord.<br/><br/>
		The back-end includes a Python Flask API, an “engine” that makes the game world “tick” (time
		pass, events happen) and MongoDB database storage.
		The front-end is a website coded in JavaScript, HTML5 and CSS.
		Accompanying these are downloadable developer and admin GUI tools to create and modify levels
		and attributes of items.</li>
</ul>
