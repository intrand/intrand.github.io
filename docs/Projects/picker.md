# picker

`picker` was a suite of web interfaces to the `random` API which displayed the results in a graphical way.

## Design

Pickers I've written so far include:

* `picker-redirect`: Allows configurable short-hand names for any of the pickers currently deployed; for example `/apex/trio.html` becomes `/at`
* `picker-apex`: Gets random legend(s) to play as (solo, duo, trio), with a randommized map as a background for the sprites
* `picker-darkestdungeon`: Gets random classes to form an adventuring party, with a campfire scene as the background for the sprites
* `picker-warframe`: Gets random suits, primary, secondary and melee combinations for a four-player squad, with various scenes from the game as the background

## Status

Shelved. I don't have time to maintain these projects right now, but even more importantly, I stopped hosting things myself. There's nowhere for them to run.
