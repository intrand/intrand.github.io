# jot

`jot` allowed you to very quickly store a note.

## Design

`jot` consistented of three components:

* `db`: A Mongo database containing all users and notes
* `api`: The gatekeeper between the front-end and database
* `web`: A front-end for the user to view, update or delete notes

## Status

Abandoned. There are other, "good enough" note-taking utilities readily available for use on any major platform. I don't have time to maintain my own.
