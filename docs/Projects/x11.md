# x11

Run an X11 display inside of a container. I had a small server plugged into a stereo, which was then plugged into a TV and built `x11` to see if we could use the small server for watching movies.

## Design

I attempted to pack as much of the display-related software and configuration as possible into a container image. This kept the server host operating system squeaky clean while the "display junk" was inside of a container.

Ultimately, this is just a Dockerfile.

## Fatal flaw

Drivers, libraries, container privileges, etc. made this a pain to maintain.

## Conclusion

Never again. Buy a 'stick' or set-top box product instead.
