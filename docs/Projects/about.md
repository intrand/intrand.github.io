# about

A project called `about` that backed the main page of [my domain](https://intrand.io).

## Design

`about` consisted of two components:

* `db`: A Mongo database that stored information I'd like to display, like random trivia about myself
* `web`: A web front-end that retrieved data from the database on the server-side, then generated a page for the user to see

## Status

Offline.

I just don't have time to maintain the project anymore.
