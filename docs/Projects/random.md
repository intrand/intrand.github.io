# random

`random` is an API that generates randomness for you. For instance, you may roll dice, get a number, a word or a character from a popular game.

## Design

* `api`: Picks a resource at random from a list of resources of the type that was asked for
* `client`: Calls the `random` API and displays the results in a terminal

## Status

Useful, but no longer running. I don't host my own software anymore.
