# idle

`idle` is my first online, [zero-player](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-player_game){target=_blank} game. Previously, I hosted this myself and you could play it at [idle.intrand.io](https://idle.intrand.io){target=_blank}, but that's no longer true.

## Design

Mongo Database <---> API server <---> client, engine, discord-bot <---> "players"

This was akin to twitch.tv "channel points" in that the player passively accumulated "progress" (levels, stats, items, etc) by simply being logged in to a discord server alongside the bot.

## Status

Back burner project.

Once in a blue moon I'll update it and make some progress, but this is now closed-source due to relative inactivity.
