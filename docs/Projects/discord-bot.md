# discord-bot

A general-purpose discord bot that contained the features I cared about in a single bot (vs many external projects).

## Design

A package of python modules to talk to APIs and do general discord bot stuff.

## Fatal flaw

There are already a bajillion other general purpose bots out there and I'm only one person.

## Conclusion

I stopped using bots. But, if I were going to, I'd just pick an existing bot or two instead of writing my own.
