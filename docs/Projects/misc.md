# misc

miscellaneous "stuff" I've written/built and what its purpose was:

## antiDab

`antiDab` was a discord bot that deleted messages it determined to contain "dab" emotes.

Status: I no longer maintain this.

## Docker Swarm cluster builder & walkthrough

Status: I don't use `docker swarm` anymore so I don't maintain this.

## k3s-exporter

My first attempt at making an exporter to describe the state of an entire cluster, rather than individual components. This was intended to be like a "green/yellow/red" for managers, rather than something in-depth. It works, but as you can imagine, it isn't incredibly useful.

Status: I no longer maintain this.

## rtmpd

`rtmpd` was a Twitch-like site that let me and some friends test our stream settings and goof around with silly ideas.

Status: I no longer maintain this.

## samba-simple

`samba-simple` was a simple-to-configure `samba` server that ran inside of a container.

Status: I no longer maintain this.

## teemip (client)

`teemip` was a python module to automate IP address management when using TeemIP.

Status: I don't use TeemIP anymore so I don't maintain this.

## vlc-headless

`vlc-headless` was a headless instance of upstream `vlc` which played my CD -> mp3 music library on random.

Status: I no longer have music locally, so I don't maintain this.
