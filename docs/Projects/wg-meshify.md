# wg-meshify

`wg-meshify` generates configuration files for `wg-quick` in a mesh architecture.

## Design

A simple program that can generate a peer-to-peer/mesh wireguard network.

Users are in charge of getting the configuration files to the nodes and getting wireguard running.

## Status

Useful! I enjoy having a free option compared to something like `tailscale` which also seems nice, but the extra bells and whistles make it more complicated in the long-term than `wg-meshify`.
