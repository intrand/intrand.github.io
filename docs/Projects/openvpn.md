# openvpn

`openvpn` was a project that ran the upstream `openvpn` project inside a container.

## Design

Stuff `openvpn` into a container so I can version control it outside of the host operating system.

## Status

Abandoned. I don't use OpenVPN anymore, so I don't maintain the project anymore.

Ultimately it's just a simple Dockerfile, so it would probably work if I tried to use it again.
